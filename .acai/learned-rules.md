- Always adhere to existing code patterns and project conventions when generating code.
- Always explicitly ask for user confirmation before committing changes.
- Always explicitly ask for user confirmation before applying edits.
- Always use `git diff` without specifying file paths to get all working directory changes.
- Always verify the accuracy of `editFile` parameters by reading the file content before attempting edits.
- Always read all modified files before creating commit messages.
- Always validate tool-specific formatting requirements, even if they appear to adhere to general standards. (The user had to correct the commit message format.)
- Always use the correct file paths based on the project structure. (The agent initially used incorrect paths: `/Users/travisennis/Github/acai-ts/src/commands` instead of `/Users/travisennis/Github/acai-ts/source/commands`.)
