When writing code follow these rules:
- Target ESNext
- VERY IMPORTANT: Follow strict TypeScript rules with proper type definitions
- IMPORTANT: Always check variables that can be undefined.
- DO NOT USE non-null assertions
- Avoid the use of the any types unless absolutely necessary.
- Apply proper error handling
- Avoid console statements only when necessary
- Use modern ES module syntax with explicit .ts file extensions in imports
- Don't use Node.js built-in modules inappropriately
- Import node built-in modules with node: prefix
