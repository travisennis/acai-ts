- Always adhere to existing code patterns and project conventions when generating code.
- Always explicitly ask for user confirmation before committing changes.
- Always replace usages console.log with usages of console.info.
- Always run a build after making code changes to verify correctness.
- Always use the most efficient workflow to complete tasks.
- Always stage changes before attempting to commit them.
- Never amend git commits without approval from the user.
