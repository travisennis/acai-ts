# Fix incorrect session file name displayed in /session command

The /session command displays an incorrect session file name format. The displayed name includes a timestamp prefix (e.g., session-2025-01-29T12-34-56-{sessionId}.json), but the actual file is saved as session-{sessionId}.json (without timestamp). This discrepancy confuses users who try to locate the session file.

Location: source/commands/session/index.ts:97
Actual format: source/sessions/manager.ts:309
