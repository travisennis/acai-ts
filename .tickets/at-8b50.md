# Improve session title generation

Currently the title is generated from the user's first message. If the user's first message is to read a file (like prompt.md), the title becomes generic. Instead, use both the user's first prompt and the assistant's first response to generate a better title. Set the title after the first response instead of immediately upon user submission.
