# Thinking/reasoning blocks not re-rendered when restoring sessions

When restoring a session using --continue, --resume flags, or the resume option in the history command, the thinking/reasoning blocks are not re-rendered in the TUI/REPL. This means users cannot see the reasoning that was previously generated.

## Acceptance Criteria

Thinking/reasoning blocks are properly re-rendered when restoring sessions via --continue flag, Thinking/reasoning blocks are properly re-rendered when restoring sessions via --resume flag, Thinking/reasoning blocks are properly re-rendered when restoring sessions via history resume option
