Suggestions for improvements:

    1. Error Handling: Enhance error handling, especially in the `applyEditBlock` function. Consider adding more specific error types and providing more detailed error messages.
    2. Logging: Implement a proper logging system instead of using `console.log` and `console.dir`. This will make it easier to debug and monitor the tool's operation.
    3. Configuration: Move hardcoded values (like the Claude model version) to a configuration file, making it easier to update and maintain.
    4. Input Validation: Add more robust input validation, especially for the file paths and content in the constructor.
    5. Batch Operations: Allow users to accept/reject multiple edits at once, rather than one at a time.
    6. Undo Functionality: Implement an undo feature to revert applied changes if needed.
    7. Testing: Add unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for the entire tool.

Potential new features:

    1. Diff Visualization: Enhance the diff display with color-coding or a more user-friendly format.
    2. Partial Acceptance: Allow users to partially accept changes within a single edit block.
    3. Edit Suggestions: Implement a feature where the AI suggests alternative edits if the user rejects the initial proposal.
    4. File Backup: Automatically create backups of files before applying changes.
    5. Change Summary: Provide a summary of all changes made in a session.
    6. Interactive Mode: Implement an interactive mode where users can make manual adjustments to the proposed edits before applying them.
    7. Version Control Integration: Add the ability to create git commits for each set of applied changes.
    8. Regex Support: Allow search and replace operations to use regular expressions for more powerful text manipulation.
    9. Multi-file Edits: Enhance the tool to handle edits that span multiple files in a single operation.
    10. Performance Optimization: For large codebases, implement caching or incremental processing to improve performance.
